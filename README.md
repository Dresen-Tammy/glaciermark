> A prerendered Angular 9 website using Firebase cloud functions backend

This is a Angular 9 project. It uses prerendered pages and lazy loading to deliver premium SEO and fast loading. It utilizes a Firebase database and cloud functions API as the backend. Images are served from AWS S3 bucket for faster loading on image-heavy pages.

## Installing / Getting started

Make sure you have node 10 and at least npm 6 installed

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Dresen-Tammy/glaciermark.git
```
Enter folder glaciermark/glaciermark

```shell
cd glaciermark/glaciermark
```
install the dependencies

```shell
npm install
``
build and serve website locally

```shell
npm run prerender
npm run serve:ssr
```

This will build the website and display it on localhost:4200

## Developing

### Built With
List main libraries, frameworks used including versions (React, Angular etc...)

### Prerequisites
What is needed to set up the dev environment. For instance, global dependencies or any other tools. include download links.


### Setting up Dev

Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing
the project further:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/your/your-project.git
cd your-project/
packagemanager install
```

And state what happens step-by-step. If there is any virtual environment, local server or database feeder needed, explain here.

### Building

If your project needs some additional steps for the developer to build the
project after some code changes, state them here. for example:

```shell
./configure
make
make install
```

Here again you should state what actually happens when the code above gets
executed.

### Deploying / Publishing
give instructions on how to build and release a new version
In case there's some step you have to take that publishes this project to a
server, this is the right time to state it.

```shell
packagemanager deploy your-project -s server.com -u username -p password
```

And again you'd need to tell what the previous code actually does.

## Versioning

We can maybe use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions available, see the [link to tags on this repository](/tags).


## Configuration

Here you should write what are all of the configurations a user can enter when
using the project.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.
Explain what these tests test and why.

```shell
Give an example
```
